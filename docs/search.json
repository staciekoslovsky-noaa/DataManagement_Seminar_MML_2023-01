And the database is designed such that the fields are atomized and the structure is adaptable.\nThe counting process works directly with the DB – allows for immediate QA/QC after counting is complete and for those data to be exported in one simple step for analysis.\nThe analytical results are ingested into the DB, and the only change required for the (future) Shiny app will be a change to the referenced data set.\nInPort metadata records, datasets on NOAA Big Data Platform and ArcGIS online are updated.\nWe start the process again…"
